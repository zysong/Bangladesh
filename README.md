Cleaning the survey data set from Ashley's public health project based in Bangladesh

The original data contains ~15,000 individual entries collected from a panel survey. A fair amount of replicates may exist with different types of input error. The goal is to identify the possible replicates and to mark and group them for further double check.

The key is to first group individual entries into small subgroups to reduce the workload for computing the similarity matrices.
